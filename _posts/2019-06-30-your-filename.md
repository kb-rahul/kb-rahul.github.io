## Is being wise different from being right?
I have always wondered how I would act if I was in a perilous situation. I wouldn't say I have been in one but my recent incident comes close to it.


What does a day on Bangalore road look like? If you ever reach your destination on time, you are mostly travelling on Saturday Evening. My incident entails a similar time-line. I was driving my car on a quiet Saturday evening (29th June 2019) when I met an accident with an auto. The auto driver rammed my car from behind. Hearing the screech from behind, I got out of my car to check if I can help the auto-driver. I saw that his vehicle had suffered a slight dent in vehicle. Thankfully, he was not injured. Within a moment, He quickly gathered a group of auto-drivers (around 10-15 people) who escalated the situation and made it extremely hostile. They started threatening me. Moreover, some of them took the comfort of **Verbally Abusing me**. Looking at the situation evolving, I quickly called the police by using their **100** number and gave them the address of the incident. They said that they would arrive as soon as possible. 
The mob saw me calling the police and became even more violent. One of them started **physically hurting**. 

Meanwhile, another member in their group started negotiating money with me (Trying to be the good cop). Given the situation, I chose to pay. I insisted that I would make an online transaction(I wanted to record their details - Phone number and UPI). The policeman arrived just then. To my amusement, his advise was 
> Settle the money and go.

Feeling extremely unsettled, I payed them and left.

Few minutes later after I left I noticed that the mob stole my headphone and powerbank which I left on the front seat. In utter disgust, I went back home. 

 I thought I would approached the police station which is closer to my house. They were highly uninterested to listen or note down the case details as the incident didn't happen under their jurisdiction. So, I am here. Developing this website and writing this blog.
 
 I tried my best to chose a nonchalant mode of expression for conveying the incident. I hope this depicts the incident in the most natural and disinterested manner as possible as I didn't want to sway the emotion of the reader in my favour so far. I am going to leave you with few thoughts that may. 

### Here are some thoughts that linger in my head:
- What should one do in my situation? I still don't have an answer? Should I abandon my daily life and approach different law keepers until someone listens? 
- Was the mob trained? They knew for sure who was going to be the good cop and who is going to be the bad cop? If so, how many people have been harassed like this?
- What made them comfortable to physically and verbally abuse me? Are they not fearful of the consequences? What does one do to protect himself/herself?
- Do the law enforcers care? Will I be ever comfortable approaching them with any issue or problems I may face?
- I am a resident of Bangalore who knows the local language. I didn't have a slightest clue about how to mitigate the situation or make the policemen listen to me. Is it is worse for non-residents?
- While discussing this situation with friends and family, the most popular opinion I received was to flee the scene and deal with consequences later. Is this right? Is this what I want my kids to learn? I could never have my moral compass deflect so far off.

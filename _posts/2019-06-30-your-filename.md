## Musing to rekindle
I have always wondered how I would act if I was in a perilous situation. I wouldn't say I have been in one but my recent experience comes close to it.


What does a day on Bangalore road look like? If you ever reach your destination on time, you are mostly travelling on a Saturday Evening. My incident entails a similar time-line. I was driving my car on a quiet Saturday evening (29th June 2019) when I met with an accident. It involved an Auto rickshaw ramming into my car from behind. Hearing the screech, I got out of my car to check if I can help the auto-driver and assess the damage on my vehicle. I saw that his vehicle had suffered a slight dent and nothing happened to my car other than a scratch on the bumper. Thankfully, the Auto-driver was not injured. 

Within a moment, He quickly gathered a group of auto-drivers (around 10-15 people) who escalated the situation and made it extremely hostile. It started with them threatening to damage my car. Then, some of them started **Verbally Abusing me**. Looking at the situation evolving, I quickly called the police by using their **100** number and gave them the address of the incident. They said that they would arrive as soon as possible.


The gang saw me calling police and became even more violent. A couple of them took the liberty to **manhandle me**. 

Meanwhile, another member in their group started negotiating money with me (_Good cop/bad cop tactics?_). Given the situation, I chose to pay. I insisted that I would make an online transaction (I wanted to record their details - Phone number and UPI). The policeman arrived just then. He was alone. He didn't own even a tiny bit of interest in listening to me. Unsurprisingly, his advise was 
> Settle the money and go.

Feeling extremely unsettled, I payed them and left.

Few minutes later, I noticed that the gang had stolen My Earphone and Powerbank. I had left them on the front seat of my car. In utter disgust and agony, I rushed home. 

 I thought I would approach a police station which is closer to my house to get help. Upon reaching the station, I realised that my attempts are futile. They were highly uninterested to note down the case details as the incident didn't happen under their jurisdiction. They expected me to travel back to a police station which was 1.5 hours away from my house so that they could lodge a complain.
 
 So, Guess what! I am here, developing this website rather and writing this blog.
 
 I tried my best to choose a nonchalant mode of expression for conveying this incident. I hope that this depicts it in a natural and disinterested manner and doesn't sway the reader in my favour. My aim is not get the reader to sympathize with me. I am disturbed. I am seeking for answers.
 
 
### Thoughts that linger in my head:
- What should one do in my situation? Should he/she abandon his daily life and approach law keepers until someone listens? 
- Was the gang trained? They understood _"The Good Cop, Bad Cop Negotiation Strategy"_. How many people have they harassed like this?
- What made them comfortable to physically and verbally abuse me? Are they not fearful of the consequences? What does one do to protect himself/herself?
- Do the law enforcers care? Will I ever be comfortable approaching them with any issue or problem I may face?
- I am a resident of Bangalore who knows the local language. I didn't have a slightest of clues about how to mitigate the situation or make the policemen listen to me. Is it more difficult for a non-resident?
- While discussing this situation with friends and family, the most popular opinion I received was to flee the scene and deal with consequences later. Is this right? Is this what I want my kids to learn? Is it wrong to trust common people of the society?. I could never have my moral compass deflect so far.

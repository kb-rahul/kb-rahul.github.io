## Happy Birthday Naidile!

I don't want to contribute our coming together as fate because I don't think it was any act of nature that made me attracted to you. I can't say I have known you for ages and I can't say that I been with you in thick and thin parts of your life but I do have this tingly sensation in me that tells me that I have chased you around as a kid. I don't have the slightest of clues on what life is going to throw at me next but I do know that I can look it in eye with you next to me. For all the fireworks, drama, grandour, thrill and love you bring to my life, I can't help but fall for you time and again.

I don't think there has been a day since I met you where I have woken up without you wishing me morning or slept without you wishing me night. It brings me great joy to hear about how your day went and makes me feel extremely luckly when I get to share about mine. Haha, Maybe it's my old age speaking about the very little things that matter to me. I know I wouldn't be the same without them.

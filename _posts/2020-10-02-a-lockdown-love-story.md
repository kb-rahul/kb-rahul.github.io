## Happy Birthday Naidile!

I don't want to contribute our coming together as fate because I don't think it was any act of nature that made me attracted to you. I can't say I have known you for ages and I can't say that I been with you in thick and thin parts of your life but I do have this tingly sensation in me that tells me that I have chased you around as a kid. I don't have the slightest of clues on what life is going to throw at me next but I do know that I can look it in eye with you next to me. For all the fireworks, drama, grandour, thrill and love you bring to my life, I can't help but fall for you time and again.

I don't think there has been a day since I met you where I have woken up without you wishing me morning or slept without you wishing me night. It brings me great joy to hear about how your day went by and makes me feel extremely luckly that I get to share mine. These have turned out become my favorite things. I know I wouldn't be the same without them. 

We know that you are turning a bit wiser today. You are a strong, beautiful, smart and an honest woman and I draw inspiration from you for the times when I want to shift into the fifth gear and pull through the cobwebs that hold me down. I see a friend in you that makes me laugh and cry at the same time. I wish we can travel anywhere and everywhere a man can lay a foot on, pose in the most clich√©d ways in front of all the monuments, drive across cities whose name we cannot pronounce, party in places where we can't speak what others understand and eat food that we haven't heard of before.

Wishing you a very Happy Birthday and a shining year ahead! I thought it was a perfect time to remind you what a phenomenal person you are. I love you ;)

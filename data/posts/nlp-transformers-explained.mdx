# NLP and Transformers Explained

The "Transformer" architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" (2017), revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP). It replaced Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs as the standard for sequence modeling.

## The Attention Mechanism

The core innovation is **Self-Attention**. It allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence relative to each other, regardless of their distance.

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

Where:

- **Q (Query)**: What we are looking for.
- **K (Key)**: What we match against.
- **V (Value)**: The information we extract.

## Architectures

### Encoder-Only (e.g., BERT)

- **Bidirectional**: Sees context from both left and right.
- **Use cases**: Classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Question Answering.

### Decoder-Only (e.g., GPT)

- **Unidirectional**: Predicts the next token based on previous ones.
- **Use cases**: Text generation, completion, creative writing.

### Encoder-Decoder (e.g., T5, BART)

- **Hybrid**: Encodes input and generates output.
- **Use cases**: Translation, Summarization.

## Scaling Laws

We've learned that model performance scales with parameter count, dataset size, and compute. This realization led to the explosion of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, PaLM, and Llama.

## Conclusion

Transformers have become the foundation of modern AI, extending beyond NLP to Computer Vision (ViT) and Audio. Understanding attention is key to understanding the current AI landscape.

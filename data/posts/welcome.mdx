# Hello, I'm Rahul

Welcome to my personal blog! I am a **Staff Machine Learning Engineer and Technical Leader** at **Coinbase**, where I build intelligent systems that solve complex real-world problems.

My career has been a journey through the evolution of modern AI—from Computer Vision to Voice Intelligence, and now to Large Language Models and Agentic AI.

## The Roots: Research & Audio Forensics

Before diving into the industry, my passion for technology was rooted in research.

- At **Carnegie Mellon University**, I worked on **FLOCTRL**, building platforms for the Laptop Orchestra.
- At **IIT Gandhinagar**, I developed algorithms for **Audio Forensics**, focusing on device recognition.

These experiences gave me a strong foundation in signal processing and algorithmic thinking.

## The Early Days: Computer Vision & Medical Imaging

My professional journey began at **Sigtuple**, where I worked on **Aadi**, a computer vision-based analyzer for andrology.

- I leveraged Deep Learning (UNet, ResNets) for morphological analysis.
- I solved complex multi-object tracking problems to analyze medical samples.

This experience taught me the rigor required to build AI systems where precision matters.

## The Voice AI Revolution: Agara

I then joined **Agara** as a Founding Machine Learning Scientist. Here, I pioneered **AI-driven voice automation**.

- We built **Voice Assist** to help human agents in real-time.
- We developed **Voice Auto**, an autonomous agent with state-of-the-art Text-to-Speech capabilities.

Agara was eventually acquired by **Coinbase**, marking the next chapter of my journey.

## The Era of GenAI: Coinbase

At **Coinbase**, I lead the development of **LLM-powered systems** that transform customer experience and security.

- **Chatbot**: Built the first in-house LLM chatbot automating ~50% of support contacts.
- **Security**: Developed "Bad Actor Guardrails" to detect fraud with >99% precision.
- **Agentic AI**: Now, I focus on building **Multi-Agent Systems** that can reason, plan, and execute tasks autonomously.

## What Drives Me

I am passionately curious. Whether it's optimizing a database query or architecting a multi-agent workflow, I love the challenge of building systems that scale.

On this blog, I'll share insights from this journey—technical deep dives into LLMs, lessons on MLOps, and thoughts on the future of AI.

Let's build the future together! 🚀

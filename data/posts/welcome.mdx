# Hello World!

I'm excited to launch my new personal website. This space will be where I share my journey as a software developer, my thoughts on technology, and my portfolio of projects.

I built this site using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, hosted on GitHub Pages. It's a great stack that allows for high performance and easy customization.

Stay tuned for more updates!

# Hello, I'm Rahul

Welcome to my personal blog! I am a **Staff Machine Learning Engineer and Technical Leader** with over 8 years of experience in the tech industry.

My career has been an exciting evolution—starting from the world of mobile and hardware integration to the cutting-edge frontier of Artificial Intelligence.

## The Early Days: Android & Hardware

I started my journey deeply embedded in the Android ecosystem. One of my earliest passions was the **Google Accessory Development Kit (ADK)**. I loved the tangible aspect of connecting software to the physical world—building custom hardware accessories that could communicate with Android devices. It taught me the importance of efficiency, resource constraints, and seamless integration.

_(Check out my [comprehensive guide on Google ADK](/posts/google-adk-basics) if you're interested in that world!)_

## The Pivot to Machine Learning

As data became the new currency, I realized the potential of **Machine Learning** to transform how we interact with technology. I transitioned my focus to AI, diving deep into:

- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Mastering TensorFlow and PyTorch to build complex models.
- **Cloud Scale**: Leveraging AWS and GCP to deploy models that serve millions of users.
- **NLP & Computer Vision**: Solving unstructured data problems.

## Where I Am Now

Today, I focus on **Technical Leadership** and **MLOps**. It's not just about building the best model anymore; it's about building reliable, scalable systems and nurturing the teams that build them.

I believe that the best ML engineers are those who understand the full stack—from the hardware constraints (like my ADK days) to the cloud infrastructure.

## What to Expect Here

On this blog, I'll be sharing:

1.  **Technical Deep Dives**: Practical guides on ML, MLOps, and Cloud Architecture.
2.  **Leadership Insights**: Lessons learned from mentoring teams and managing complex projects.
3.  **Retro Tech**: Occasional throwbacks to Android and embedded systems.

I'm excited to connect with you all. Feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-k-b-726a81a0/) or [email](mailto:kb.rahul15@gmail.com).

Let's build the future together! 🚀

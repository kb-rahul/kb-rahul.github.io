# Hello, I'm Rahul

Welcome to my personal blog! I am a **Staff Machine Learning Engineer and Technical Leader** with over 8 years of experience in the tech industry.

My career has been an exciting evolution—starting from traditional software engineering and mobile development to the cutting-edge frontier of **Agentic AI**.

## The Evolution: From Mobile to ML

I started my journey with a strong foundation in software engineering, working extensively with **Android** and mobile ecosystems. This taught me the importance of efficiency, resource constraints, and user-centric design.

As data became the new currency, I realized the potential of **Machine Learning** to transform how we interact with technology. I transitioned my focus to AI, diving deep into:

- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Mastering TensorFlow and PyTorch to build complex models.
- **Cloud Scale**: Leveraging AWS and GCP to deploy models that serve millions of users.
- **NLP & Computer Vision**: Solving unstructured data problems.

## The New Frontier: Multi-Agent Systems

Today, my passion lies in **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**. We are witnessing a paradigm shift where AI is no longer just about generating text, but about **acting** in the world.

I specialize in frameworks like **Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, building systems where multiple specialized agents collaborate to solve complex workflows. It's about moving from "Chat with your data" to "Work with your agents."

_(Check out my [deep dive on Google ADK](/posts/google-adk-basics) to learn more about building agentic architectures!)_

## Where I Am Now

Today, I focus on **Technical Leadership** and **MLOps**. It's not just about building the best model anymore; it's about building reliable, scalable agentic systems and nurturing the teams that build them.

## What to Expect Here

On this blog, I'll be sharing:

1.  **Technical Deep Dives**: Practical guides on Agents, ADK, and Cloud Architecture.
2.  **Leadership Insights**: Lessons learned from mentoring teams and managing complex AI projects.
3.  **Future of AI**: Thoughts on where Agentic AI is heading.

I'm excited to connect with you all. Feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-k-b-726a81a0/) or [email](mailto:kb.rahul15@gmail.com).

Let's build the future together! 🚀

# My Path to Coding

I've always been fascinated by how things work. My journey into software development started with a curiosity about the web and how websites are built.

Over the years, I've explored various technologies, from HTML and CSS to complex backend systems. I'm constantly learning and evolving, and I love the challenge that coding brings.

In this blog, I plan to document my learning process, share tips and tricks I pick up along the way, and connect with other developers.

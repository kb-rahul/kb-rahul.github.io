# Multi-Agent Chatbot Systems

Single-agent systems are often insufficient for complex, multi-step tasks. **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)** involve multiple specialized agents collaborating to achieve a goal. This mimics a human team structure.

## Why Multi-Agent?

- **Specialization**: One agent can be a "Coder," another a "Reviewer," and another a "Product Manager."
- **Robustness**: Agents can critique and correct each other's work.
- **Scalability**: Complex workflows can be broken down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.

## Frameworks

### AutoGen (Microsoft)

AutoGen allows defining agents that can converse with each other. It supports human-in-the-loop and various conversation patterns.

### CrewAI

CrewAI focuses on role-playing agents. You define a "Crew" of agents with specific roles, goals, and backstories, and assign them tasks.

## Example Scenario: Software Development

Imagine a user asks: "Create a snake game in Python."

1.  **Product Manager Agent**: Breaks down the requirements (UI, logic, controls).
2.  **Developer Agent**: Writes the code based on requirements.
3.  **QA Agent**: Reviews the code, checks for bugs, and asks the Developer to fix them.
4.  **User Proxy Agent**: Executes the code and reports the output.

## Challenges

- **Coordination**: Ensuring agents stay on track and don't get stuck in loops.
- **Cost & Latency**: Multiple agent calls increase token usage and response time.
- **Evaluation**: Debugging interactions between agents is harder than debugging a single prompt.

## Conclusion

Multi-agent systems represent the next frontier in AI automation. They enable us to move from simple "chatbots" to powerful "agentic workflows" that can perform real work.

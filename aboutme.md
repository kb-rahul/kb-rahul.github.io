I am a Data Scientist at AgaraLabs who works on exploiting Deep Learning for Speech and Natural Language Processing. 
I was previously working on Computer Vision based Applications at SigTuple (I have a lot of interesting stories here, perhaps you should ask me in person xP). 
Of late, My Research interest has been Speech Signal Processing, Automatic Speech Recognition, Speech Synthesis, Deep Learning and Multimodal Signal Processing/Machine Learning.

From the inception of my professional career, 
I have been actively involved in Software Development to cater the needs of my organisation and taken up keen interest in learning about it. 
My hobbies span a huge spectrum, some of them are: Football, Boxing, Yoga, Travelling and Philosophy.

So, It is safe to say that I believe that **jack of all trades > ace of one**. 
You get the idea by now, I am that friend who sounds self obsessed, egotistic and narcissistic but take a leap of faith and 
assume that I am humble guy who is filled with great thoughts and wants to compile it somewhere.


#### Why start a blog?
 * I hope to write about my research misadventures, development tips and tricks, my thoughts about any popular opinion, 
 Raise questions which I need your opinion on and many more topics which I can't think of right now.
 * I feel that I hold strong unpopular opinion and I want to share it.
 * It feels good to be heard.
 * Every once in a while I have incidents that I want to describe in words but lack the impetus to make me work on creating a website and host it. I couldn't say the same about my recent one.
 * I am not a big fan of any social media platforms.
 * Learning how to use jekyll adds a new skill-set to my profile xP.

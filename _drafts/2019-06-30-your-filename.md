## Don't be evil? 

I have always wondered how I would act if I was in a perilous situation. I wouldn't say I have been in one but my recent incident comes close to it.


So, what does a day on Bangalore road look like? If you ever to reach your destination of time, you are mostly travelling on Saturday Evening. My incident entails a similar time-line. I was driving my car on Quiet Saturday evening when I met an accident with an auto driver. The auto driver was rammed my car from behind. Hearing the screech from behind, I got out to help the auto-driver and saw that his vehicle had suffered a slight dent on vehicle. Thankfully, he had was not injured. Within a moment, He quickly gathered a group of auto-drivers (around 10-15 people) who escalated it to an extremely hostile situation. They started threatening and *verbally abusing* me. Looking at the evolving situation, I quickly called the police by using their *100* number and gave them the address of the incident. They said they would arrive as soon as possible. 
The mob saw me calling the police and got even more violent. One of them started *physically hurting*. 

Another person in their group started negotiating money with me (Trying to be the good cop). Given the situation, I chose to pay. I insisted that I would pay only as I don't have any other mode of payment (I wanted to record his details). The police arrived just after I finished the transaction. To my amusement, his advise was  
___Settle the money and go___.
